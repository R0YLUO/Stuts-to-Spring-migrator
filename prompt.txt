Below I have provided the code for a struts.xml file as well as a struts action class.
I need you to analyse the code in struts.xml file and find all the routes and that 
map to the provided struts action class methods, then use all this information to 
convert the struts action class to a spring controller class, ensuring all the routes
are mapped according to the struts.xml configuration for the particular struts action
class that is being converted. Ensure to use com.poc.spring as the package structure for 
the converted Spring code. Structure your response to return an appropriate filename 
of the Spring controller class, as well as the code for the Spring controller class, in
the following format:
Filename - <filename>
Code - <code>
